# NYC_taxi_trip_time_prediction
Problem Statement : Nowadays, most of the people prefer to travel using taxis as in cities due to less area or parking and maintenance issues people prefer rental cabs instead of buying cars. So business problem is to provide the estimated time of trip duration such that customer can book a cab on time in order to reach their destination on time.
In this project my goal is "to predict NYC Taxi trip duration" using various linear and non linear regression models.
